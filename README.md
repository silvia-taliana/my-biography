#My Biography

This project aims to create a biography using elements from bootsrap to create a responsive website viewable on multiple sized screens. 

The basic outline was created first for each page of the website (about me, portfolio, contact) and linked to bootstrap.
A nav bar was created to take the user to the different pages of the website. CSS styling was added to help place everything in the right position with padding, margins and position elements.  
Boostrap was the used to divide different sections into rows and colums so everything was positioned using the 12 column rule. It was also used to insert the nav bar, the form for the contact page and the submit button.
