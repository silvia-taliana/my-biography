                        My name is Silvia Taliana and I am aspriring to be a full stack web developer. I was born and
                        raised in Adelaide. I have a degree in nursing and have done this amazing career for five years
                        so far. Even though my nursing has been both a rewarding and challenging experience, I have
                        realised that it is just not for me, so I am moving on to bigger and better things. My hobbies
                        include art (you can see my drawings in my portfolio), going to the gym wearing fun gym wear,
                        and being a plant mum (maybe a little too obsessively.. just maybe though). I am also a mum to a
                        wonderful and boisterous labrador x staffy named Hendrix, a bearded dragon named Giz and a
                        murray darling python named Monty, so it's a full house!. I love travelling and some of the
                        highlights of my previous travels include the day I visited Buckingham Palace for the Queen's
                        garden tea party and the day I went to Harry Potter World in England (also just a little
                        obsessed with Harry Potter...). I also enjoy dressing up as a Hippie for dress up parties
                        because I believe it expresses the bright and bubbly person within me.
